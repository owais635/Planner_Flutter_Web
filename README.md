## Goal

The goal of this project was to learn a little about [Flutter for Web](https://flutter.dev/web), and discovering if it would be a good candidate for making a Web App for my Android App [Homework Planner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siawo.android.planner).

## Features
- A responsive landing page.
- Basic App Navigation.
